LED Controlling over IOT

	In our project we are controlling the LED using IOT. For that NodeMCU esp8266 open-source controller board is used , which has an inbuilt wifi module using this we are able to send and receive the command from anywhere.
            To control the LED we need a webpage (which is nothing but a dashboard to send the command to the controller via the internet), for that we are using the Blynk 2.0 it is a free platform to create the device dashboard.

Components Required

Hardware:
NodeMCU ESP8266,
LED,
Jumper wires.
